# Prediction of Product Sales Project
## Project Overview

In this project, we are cleaning the 'Prediction of Product Sales' dataset and using it for analysis purposes. This includes but isn't limited to exploratory data analysis and feature inspection.

## Data Visualizations

1. The heatmap below illustrates how different features in the data frame are connected. I've included labels in each box to provide more information about the specific correlation values and enhance the overall understanding of the graph.

2. The bar graph below shows how many of each item type exists in the data frame. This type of graph is beneficial to stakeholders because it is easy to identify key details such as max, min, and the relationship between the quantities of their products.
